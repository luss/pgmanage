# PgManage
![](https://pgmanage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/intro.png)

PgManage is a modern Postgres-centric graphical database client, though we will be adding features for
developers the initial focus is on the "management" of Postgres.

We proudly leverage all of the great work done by the original
(now dormant) project https://github.com/OmniDB/OmniDB
